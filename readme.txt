What Is This?

This mod makes explosives deadly to trees.

Grenades and M79 40mm explosives will knock down surrounding bushes and small trees, while Claymores, Plastic Explosives and Improvised Explosives will knock down large trees as well as small ones.

There is a JSON config that allows you to specify the blast radius and what trees/bushes it destroys for each explosive.

Installation Instructions:

Install this mod like any other mod - copy it into your server folder and add it to your mods list. Make sure to copy the .bikey into your server keys if you're not using a server management tool like OmegaManager which does that automatically.

This mod should theoretically work fine as a server-side only mod, but if you have any issues then add it to your server's mod pack.

When you run the mod for the first time a default JSON config will be created in your server profile: %server_root%/profiles/Zenarchist/ZenTreesplosionsConfig.json

Repack & Source Code:

You can repack this mod if you like, and do anything else you want with it for that matter. Just keep in mind my future updates and improvements won't be applied so make sure to check back for new versions if you notice any bugs. The source code is on my GitHub at www.zenarchist.io

Enjoy!
